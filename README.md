# NetflixClone
This repository houses a functional clone of a popular streaming service (think Netflix!), built to demonstrate front-end development skills and user interface (UI) design capabilities.
</br>
This project serves as a learning and development exercise, and the content library is likely not a replica of the original platform. It's recommended to respect copyrights and terms of service of any streaming service you might use for inspiration.
</br>
Feel free to: </br>
  Fork, clone, and tinker with the code! </br>
  Contribute your enhancements to make this project even more comprehensive.</br>
